/*
 * Linked list have following properties:
 * -> Successive elements are connected by pointers/reference.
 * -> The last element points to NULL
 * -> Can grow or shrink in size during execution of a program
 * -> Can be made just as long as required (until systems memory exhausts)
 * -> Does not waste memory space. It allocates memory as list grows.
 *
 * Advantages:
 * ==========
 * ->	Grow-able in nature based on need.
 * -> 	Insertion and deletion at beginning is O(1). So ,preferable when insertion/
 * 		deletion is frequent operation.

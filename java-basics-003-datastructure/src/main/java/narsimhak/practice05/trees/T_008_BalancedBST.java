/*
 * 	->	In earlier sections we have seen different trees whose worst case complexity is O(n), where n is the number 
 * 		of nodes in the tree. This happens when the trees are skew trees. In this section we will try to reduce 
 * 		this worst case complexity to O(logn) by imposing restrictions on the heights.
 * 	->	In general, the height balanced trees are represented with HB(k), where k is the difference between left 
 * 		subtree height and right subtree height. Sometimes k is called balance factor.
 * 	
 * 	Full Balanced Binary Search Trees
 * 	---------------------------------
 * 	->	In HB(k), if k = 0 (if balance factor is zero), then we call such binary search trees as full balanced binary 
 * 		search trees. That means, in HB(0) binary search tree, the difference between left subtree height and right 
 * 		subtree height should be at most zero. This ensures that the tree is a full binary tree.

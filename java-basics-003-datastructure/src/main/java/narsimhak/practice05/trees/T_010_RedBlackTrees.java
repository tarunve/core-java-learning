/*
 * 	->	In Red-black trees each node is associated with an extra attribute: the color, which is either red or black. 
 * 	->	Definition: A Red-black tree is a binary search tree that satisfies the following properties:
 * 					->	Root Property: the root is black
 * 					->	External Property: every leaf is black
 * 					->	Internal Property: the children of a red node are black	
 * 					->	Depth Property: all the leaves have the same black
 * 	->	Similar to AVL trees, if the Red-black tree becomes imbalanced, then we perform rotations to reinforce the 
 * 		balancing property. With Red-black trees, we can perform the following operations in O(logn) in worst case,
 * 		where n is the number of nodes in the trees.
 * 		->	Insertion
 * 		->	Deletion
 * 		->	Find predecessor
 * 		->	Find successor
 * 		->	Find minimum
 * 		->	Find maximum

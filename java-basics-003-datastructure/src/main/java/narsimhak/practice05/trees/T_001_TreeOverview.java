 * 	->	A tree is a data structure similar to a linked list but instead of each node pointing simply
 * 		to the next node in a linear fashion, each node points to a number of nodes. Tree is an example
 * 		of nonlinear data structures. A tree structure is a way of representing the hierarchical nature
 * 		of a structure in a graphical form.

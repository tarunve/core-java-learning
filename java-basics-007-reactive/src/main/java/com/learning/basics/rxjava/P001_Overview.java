/**
 *  RxJava:
 *  ======
 *  -   RxJava is a Java based extension of ReactiveX. It provides implementation or ReactiveX
 *      project in Java. Following are the key characteristics of RxJava.
 *      -   Extends the observer pattern.
 *      -   Support sequences of data/events.
 *      -   Provides operators to compose sequences together declaratively.
 *      -   Handles threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures internally.
 *
 *  What is ReactiveX?
 *  -----------------
 *  -   ReactiveX is a project which aims to provide reactive programming concept to various
 *      programming languages. Reactive Programming refers to the scenario where program reacts
 *      as and when data appears. It is a event based programming concept and events can propagate
 *      to registers observers.
 *  -   As per the Reactive, they have combined the best of Observer pattern, Iterator pattern and
 *      functional pattern.
 *  -   The Observer pattern done right. ReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from the
 *      Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming.
 *
 *  Key components of RxJava
 *  ------------------------
 *  -   RxJava have two key components: Observables and Observer.
 *  -   Observable − It represents an object similar to Stream which can emit zero or more data,
 *      can send error message, whose speed can be controlled while emitting a set of data, can
 *      send finite as well as infinite data.
 *  -   Observer − It subscribes to Observable's data of sequence and reacts per item of the
 *      observables. Observers are notified whenever Observable emits a data. An Observer handles
 *      data one by one.

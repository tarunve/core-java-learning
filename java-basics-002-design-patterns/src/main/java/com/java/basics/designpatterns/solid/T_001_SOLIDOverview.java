/**
 * 	->	SOLID is one of the most well-known sets of software design principles. It can help you avoid common 
 * 		pitfalls and think about your applications architecture from a higher level.		
 *	->	SOLID design principles are five software design principles that enable you to write effective object-oriented code.
 *	->	Knowing about OOP principles like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism is important, but how 
 *		would you use them in your everyday work? SOLID design principles have become so popular in recent years because 
 *		they answer this question in a straightforward way.
 *	->	The SOLID name is a mnemonic acronym where each letter represents a software design principle, as follows:
 *		1.	S - for Single Responsibility Principle
 *		2.	O - for Open/Closed Principle
 *		3.	L - for Liskov Substitution Principle
 *		4.	I - for Interface Segregation Principle
 *		5.	D - for Dependency Inversion Principle
 *	->	The five principles overlap here and there, and programmers use them broadly. SOLID principles lead to more flexible 
 *		and stable software architecture that’s easier to maintain and extend, and less likely to break.
 *
 *
 *  Advantages :
 *  1.  Avoid Duplicate Code
 *  2.  Easy to maintain
 *  3.  Easy to Understand
 *  4.  Flexible Software
 *  5.  Reduce Complexity
 *  6.  Extensible Code
